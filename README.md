_Increase focus by minimizing distraction._

Do you frequently open links or articles in new tabs, intending to go back and read them later?  If you do this too often, you may overwhelmed with your "reading list".  Everytime you sit down to your computer to work, you may feel distracted by the pending tasks to complete.  This can quickly become distracting, preventing you from getting your work done.

**RoutineClean** aims to fix that by closing tabs that have been open for too long.  If you were going to look at those tabs, you already would have.  If they were that important, you would have bookmarked them.  So let **RoutineClean** take care of it for you and help increase your focus.
